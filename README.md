# Digital-Thermostat-with-Hysteresis

The Digital Thermostat with Hysteresis is a temperature control system that automatically manages heating or cooling devices to maintain a specified temperature range. Hysteresis control ensures that the system does not frequently switch on and off around the target temperature, thus reducing wear on devices and conserving energy.

Components Used
Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22, or LM35): Measures the ambient temperature.
Relay Module: Controls the heating or cooling device.
LCD Display: Shows the current temperature, target temperature, and system status.
Buttons:
Up Button: Increases the target temperature.
Down Button: Decreases the target temperature.
